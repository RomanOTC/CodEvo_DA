      "Author: ['Patrick Kingsley', 'Eric Schmitt', 'Ronen Bergman']\n",
      "Publish Date: 2024-10-02 00:00:00\n",
      "Content: For years, Israel and Iran avoided direct confrontation, as Israel secretly sabotaged Tehran’s interests and assassinated its officials without claiming responsibility, and Iran encouraged allies to attack Israel while rarely doing so itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the two countries seem prepared to risk a direct, prolonged and extraordinarily costly conflict.\n",
      "\n",
      "After Israel invaded Lebanon to confront Iran’s strongest ally, Hezbollah, and Iran’s second massive missile attack on Israel in less than six months, Israel seems ready to strike Iran directly, in a much more forceful and public way than it ever has, and Iran has warned of massive retaliation if it does.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are in a different story right now,” said Yoel Guzansky, a former senior security official who oversaw Iran strategy on Israel’s National Security Council. “We have a consensus in Israel — among the military, the defense experts, analysts and politicians — that Israel should respond in force to Iran’s attack.”\n",
      "\n",
      "To many Israelis, there is now little to lose: Iran’s efforts to strike the urban sprawl around Tel Aviv crossed a threshold that Tehran has never previously breached, even during its earlier missile attack in April, which targeted air bases but not civilian areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Critics of Israel often see the country as the primary instigator of unrest in the Middle East. But most Israelis see themselves as the victims of constant attack from Iran’s proxies — particularly Hamas in Gaza, the Houthis in Yemen and Hezbollah in Lebanon — and feel that they have not done enough to defend themselves. As a result, there are growing calls in Israel to make Iran fully accountable for its allies’ attacks, even if it risks an explosive reaction.\n",

      "\n",
      "A day after a wave of missiles from Iran forced people into bomb shelters and safe rooms, and just hours before the holiday began at sunset, Israelis learned that eight soldiers had been killed in fighting with Iranian-backed Hezbollah militants in Lebanon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We just want a normal year,” said Sigalit Orr, a tech consultant who lives in Hod Hasharon, a densely populated Tel Aviv suburb where more than 100 homes were damaged by Iran’s missile attack on Tuesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, issued a short, grim video message just before the holiday began, expressing his condolences to the families of the fallen Israeli soldiers, but also warning that the conflict was far from over. “We are in the middle of a tough war against Iran’s axis of evil, which seeks to destroy us,” he said. “This will not happen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "On Tuesday night, Iran launched about 200 ballistic missiles at Israel in what it said was retaliation for assassinations of top leaders of its proxy groups, including those of Hamas’s political chief, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran in July, widely attributed to Israel, and of Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in an airstrike near Beirut on Friday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Addressing the nation, Mr. Netanyahu vowed that Israel would return about 70 living hostages still being held in Gaza nearly a year after the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack that sparked a devastating war in the enclave. He also promised to return the more than 60,000 residents of northern Israel displaced from their homes after Hezbollah, in solidarity with Hamas, began firing rockets into Israel on Oct. 8, sparking what has become another war.\n",

      "Publish Date: 2024-10-02 00:00:00\n",
      "Content: The first question of the vice-presidential debate on Tuesday night was whether the candidates would support or oppose a pre-emptive strike on Iran by Israel. It framed the issue for Gov. Tim Walz and Senator JD Vance as urgent to consider because Tehran has “drastically reduced the time it would take to develop a nuclear weapon,” cutting its acquisition time to “one or two weeks.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The premise behind the question from Margaret Brennan of CBS News, one of the debate’s moderators, highlights a popular confusion over what it takes to build a usable nuclear bomb.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nuclear experts said on Wednesday that it would take Iran not weeks to make a nuclear weapon, but months and possibly as long as a year. Ms. Brennan’s question, they added, began the debate on a false note.\n",

      "“I don’t think there’s a danger that Iran this year is going to start exploding nuclear weapons,” said Houston G. Wood, an emeritus professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at the University of Virginia. A specialist in atomic centrifuges and other nuclear matters, Dr. Wood estimated that it would take Iran up to a year to devise a weapon once it had enough nuclear fuel.\n",

Trump with a criminal conspiracy over his attempt to overturn his loss of the 2020 election has filed a lengthy brief laying out his key evidence along with an argument for why the case should be able to go forward despite the Supreme Court’s ruling in July on presidential immunity.\n",

      "The prosecutor revealed new evidence.\n",

      "None of the new details were game-changing revelations, but they add further texture to the available history.

      "Title: Opinion | Putin Keeps Threatening to Use Nuclear Weapons. Would He?\n",
      "Author: ['Lawrence Freedman']\n",
      "Publish Date: 2024-10-03 00:00:00\n",
      "Content: Last week, President Vladimir Putin announced a plan to change Russia’s nuclear doctrine. He said Russia would be prepared to use a nuclear weapon in response to an attack with conventional weapons that creates a “critical threat to our sovereignty” and would treat “aggression against Russia by any nonnuclear state, but with the participation or support of a nuclear state,” as a “joint attack on the Russian Federation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the key change, and it’s not subtle. Nor is it meant to be. Its purpose is to influence Washington on the specific question of whether to grant Ukraine’s request to use American weapons systems against targets inside Russia, and more generally to persuade Western leaders to take Mr. Putin’s threats more seriously. His problem is that he is unable to describe situations, however belligerent his rhetoric, in which using nuclear weapons would make sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since Russia annexed Crimea, in 2014, Mr. Putin has been signaling to NATO countries that they risk nuclear war if they interfere on the side of Ukraine. Whether in the form of blustery propaganda, somber announcements or drills, these signals have consistently been designed to exude menace without ever quite committing to nuclear use.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Mr. Putin announced the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, he warned that those standing “in our way” must know “that Russia will respond immediately, and the consequences will be such as you have never seen in your entire history.” In September 2022 (when U.S. officials were particularly worried about nuclear escalation) he said, “If the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, we will certainly use all the means at our disposal to protect Russia and our people. This is not a bluff.”\n",

      "Content: Update, 2:15 p.m.: As forecast below, Iran launched nearly 200 ballistic missiles at Israel beginning around 12:30 p.m. Eastern time. The Israeli antimissile system shot down almost all of them, Israeli sources said, and while there was some damage the attack was not considered particularly successful. There are no reports at this time of extensive casualties.\n",
      "\n",
      "The attack was executed by the Air Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and was not an operation of the regular Iranian army or air force, according to Israeli sources. The Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, was not informed of the attack until shortly before it began, the sources said, indicating that the Iranian regime is divided over the operation, which will probably add to the fractures in the government.\n",
      "\n",
      "Israel’s ability to anticipate the Iranian strike and name the precise hour of the attack, and the fact that it was a revolutionary guards operation — not the regular Iranian armed forces under the command of the new president — demonstrates how deeply the Mossad, Israel’s cyber command, Unit 8200, and the Israeli Air Force have penetrated the Iranian regime and coordinated their defensive response. It means no Iranian leader can trust another anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "We may be about to enter what could be the most dangerous moment in the history of the modern Middle East: a ballistic missile war between Iran and Israel, which would almost certainly bring in the United States on Israel’s side and could culminate in a full-blown U.S.-Israeli effort to destroy Iran’s nuclear program.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is the assessment I have gleaned from talking to Israeli intelligence sources, whose analysis is that Iran plans to launch a missile attack against Israel at 12:30 p.m. Eastern time, which is 7:30 p.m. in Israel. The attack is planned in two waves 15 minutes apart, and each wave will involve 110 ballistic missiles, the Israelis said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Iranian missiles are aimed at three targets. First, the headquarters of the Mossad, Israel’s foreign intelligence service, near Tel Aviv. Second, the Israeli air base at Nevatim, and third, the Israeli air base at Khatzirim; both bases are in the south of Israel in the Negev Desert. The Israeli officials are particularly concerned about any strike on Mossad headquarters because it is in the densely populated north Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Hasharon. It is also not far from the Israeli defense intelligence headquarters, Unit 8200.\n",
      "\n",
      "This information has been shared with me because the Israelis insist that they do not want a full-scale ballistic war with Iran, and want the United States to try to deter the Iranians by letting them know that if they do launch this missile attack, the United States will not be a bystander, and its response, unlike with the April 13 Iranian missile and drone attack on Israel, will not be purely defensive. In other words, Iran could be risking its entire nuclear program if this missile attack goes ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have not been able to speak to any senior U.S. officials to gauge their reactions, but will update this blog post as I do.\n",
      "\n",
      "One might think that Israel is itching for this kind of war with Iran to finally take out its nuclear program and involve the United States. That is not my impression. A war of ballistic missiles could do enormous damage to Israel’s infrastructure unless virtually every missile is intercepted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Could the Iranians be bluffing and intending to land the missiles in open areas in Israel? That is not the impression the Israelis have gleaned from their intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Israeli intelligence assessment is that the Iranian people by and large do not want this war with Israel. There has long been discontent in Iran over the billions of dollars the regime has spent supporting Hamas and Hezbollah at a time when Iranian infrastructure is so dilapidated and the country’s economy is on its back. The message the Israelis hope the U.S. can convey to Iran is also that if they start this war and it leads to great destruction and death of Iranian civilians, it could also trigger an uprising against the regime.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the last year we have seen red lines crossed left and right — from the savage Hamas onslaught on Israel on Oct. 7 to the Israeli pager attack against Hezbollah’s leadership and the assassination of its leader, Hassan Nasrallah. The Iranians feel their deterrence has been eroded and need to respond.\n",

      "At least five people have been killed and eight wounded in an Israeli air strike on a building in central Beirut, Lebanese officials have said. The multi-storey block in Bachoura housed a Hezbollah-affiliated health centre, which Israel's military said was hit in a \"precision\" attack. This is the first Israeli strike close to Beirut's centre - just metres away from Lebanon's parliament. There were five other air strikes overnight against targets in the southern suburb of Dahieh. It comes after the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said eight soldiers had been killed in combat in southern Lebanon, its first losses since the start of ground operations against the Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Large explosion in Beirut as IDF says it conducted 'precise' strike\n",
      "\n",
      "Hezbollah said it had destroyed Israeli tanks during the fighting and insisted it had enough men and ammunition to push back the forces. Earlier, the IDF announced that more infantry and armoured troops had joined the operation seeking to dismantle what it called “terrorist infrastructure” in Lebanese border villages. In the latest overnight strikes, three explosions were heard in Dahieh, in the city's southern suburbs - with a fourth closer to the centre. There were two further air strikes in Dahieh, which came after the IDF warned people living nearby that it was targeting what it said were facilities belonging to Hezbollah in the area of the city known to be its stronghold. Before the overnight air strikes, Lebanon's health ministry said 46 people had been killed and 85 wounded in Israeli bombings in the last 24 hours, without differentiating between civilians and combatants. It also emerged a US permanent resident from the state of Michigan was among those killed in recent Israeli air strikes on Lebanon. Kamel Ahmad Jawad, 56, was in the country to care for his elderly mother, according to The Detroit News. His death was confirmed by a White House official, who said: \"His death is a tragedy, as are the deaths of many civilians in Lebanon.\" Hezbollah has been weakened after two weeks of Israeli strikes and other attacks that have killed more than 1,200 people across Lebanon and displaced around 1.2 million, according to Lebanese authorities. Israel has gone on the offensive after almost a year of cross-border hostilities sparked by the war in Gaza, saying it wants to ensure the safe return of residents of border areas displaced by Hezbollah attacks. Hezbollah is a Shia Islamist political, military and social organisation that wields considerable power in Lebanon. It is designated as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, the UK and other countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the second full day of their ground invasion into Lebanon, Israeli troops encountered Hezbollah fighters for the first time. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement on Wednesday that soldiers backed by aircraft had “eliminated terrorists and dismantled terrorist infrastructure through precision-guided munitions and close-range engagements” in several southern Lebanese areas. Later, the IDF announced that eight troops had been killed in action. Most were commandos from the elite Egoz and Golani Reconnaissance units. Hezbollah said its fighters had fired ani-tank missiles at Israeli commandos, killing and wounding dozens during clashes early on Wednesday in one border village. It also said that other troops were targeted with explosives and gunfire on the outskirts of Kafr Kila, and that three Israeli Merkava tanks were destroyed by missiles near Maroun al-Ras. Hezbollah has spent years building infrastructure in southern Lebanon that includes extensive underground tunnels. It also has thousands of fighters, who know the area well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paying tribute to the eight soldiers, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said they had fallen ”in the midst of a tough war against Iran’s axis of evil, which seeks to destroy us”. “This will not happen, because we will stand together, and with God’s help, we will win together,” he added. Israeli air defences were also in action again a day after they repelled the vast majority of the more than 180 ballistic missiles launched by Iran towards Israel on Tuesday night in retaliation for the Israeli air strike in Beirut last Friday that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and a top Iranian commander. More than 240 rockets were fired from southern Lebanon towards northern Israel throughout Wednesday, according to the IDF. Netanyahu insists that the ground offensive in Lebanon will degrade Hezbollah’s capability and push its fighters back, eventually allowing about 60,000 Israelis to return to their homes near the border. Meanwhile US President Joe Biden said he did not support an Israeli retaliatory strike on Iranian nuclear sites. He added that the US \"will be discussing with the Israelis what they're gonna do\" in response to the Iranian barrage.\n",

      "A man charged with sexual assault has been advertising as a private tutor for children in maths and science, a BBC investigation has found. The man, who we’re not naming for legal reasons, left his job as a teacher last year. Bail conditions prevent him having any contact with children and he is due to stand trial in March. We also found another teacher who has been barred from the classroom by a disciplinary panel but is now advertising one-to-one online tutoring sessions. It comes after the BBC reported more than 90 private tutors had been convicted of sexual crimes against children over the last 20 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "BBC News has continued to examine the tutoring industry, in which there is no legal obligation for private tutors to undergo any background checks or be qualified to teach. Charities say the cases of the two private tutors highlight a lack of regulation in this area.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man charged with sexual assault only removed his tutoring ad after the BBC contacted him\n",
      "\n",
      "Until recently the ex-teacher who is charged with sexual assault had a personal tutoring website and an online advertisement which remained active. The ad was only removed after the BBC made contact. We don’t know whether the man continued giving private lessons in maths and science after he was charged, but in a phone call he claimed to have stopped. “It’s a massive hole in safeguarding,” says Marilyn Hawes, chief executive of the child protection campaigning group Freedom from Abuse. “It’s a huge risk. The onus is on the individual [tutor] to be honest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The second tutor we found is a former science teacher who was brought before a disciplinary panel after taking a pupil on an overnight trip. The panel heard the girl's parents had given permission for the outing and ruled that his interest in the child had been paternal and not sexual in nature. But it decided his conduct was unacceptable and he had failed to maintain appropriate professional boundaries. He was banned from teaching indefinitely and cannot teach in any school, sixth form college, relevant youth accommodation or children's home in England. He has been given permission to appeal against the decision in two years’ time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Criminal checks\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyone wanting to work with children has to apply for a DBS - or Disclosure and Barring service - check, which looks at criminal records and other databases of individuals banned from this kind of work. There are three types, basic, standard and the most detailed - an enhanced check. Under current regulations the former teacher does not need a DBS check to work as a tutor. But in his case, if an enhanced check had been done, it would have revealed the outcome of the disciplinary panel. We discovered the man is still offering private online tuition. We contacted him, posing as a parent, asking about lessons for a 15-year-old girl. He messaged back, offering GCSE support with exam techniques and a trial online lesson.\n",

      "Following our investigation in September, the Children’s Commissioner for England, Dame Rachel de Souza, called for all private tutors to be properly DBS checked.

She told the tutor’s agency but it took no action. “I later found out the tutor had been in a news report for physical assault,” she said. “My daughter was put at risk.” The BBC has not corroborated their stories.\n",

      "The tutor who had been charged with sexual assault had been advertising on a website called Superprof. It claims to be the top platform for private tutoring in the UK. The company says it expects its tutors to have a DBS check and it encourages them to keep it updated. There’s no suggestion that Superprof could have known about the charge against this particular tutor. It’s not clear when the man posted his advert, or whether he provided a clear DBS check, carried out before he was charged.\n",

      "However, even an enhanced DBS only provides a snapshot of the applicant’s criminal record at the time of application. Superprof told BBC News: “Our priority is the safety and wellbeing of everyone who uses the platform.” The platform said tutors are asked to upload identification, education and work credentials when they sign up. Tutors also contacted the BBC to say they want to be able to get an enhanced DBS check to reassure clients. But these can only be applied for by an employer or an approved organisation. One told us: “It should be a legal requirement, just like if you work in a school.”\n",

      "The government says it expects tutoring agencies to follow safeguarding guidance - and that means DBS checks should be undertaken. The Department for Education says it is now considering what further action might be appropriate. Ms Hawes, from Freedom from Abuse, suggests adults accompany children to tutoring sessions, adding: “If you’re taking your child to a tutor’s home, sit in the room with them, sit in the corner and read a book while they’re having their lesson.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Donald Trump \"resorted to crimes\" in an effort to overturn his 2020 election defeat, prosecutors allege in a new court filing that argues the former president is not immune from charges. Special Counsel Jack Smith, the prosecutor appointed to lead the election interference case against Trump, submitted the filing, which was publicly released on Wednesday. The filing challenges Trump's claim that he is protected by a landmark Supreme Court ruling this summer that grants broad immunity from prosecution for official acts conducted while in office. Since there will be no trial before Trump, a Republican, vies with his Democratic rival Kamala Harris for the White House in next month's election, the 165-page court document may be the last chance for prosecutors to outline their case.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Wednesday's filing, prosecutors allege Trump was not always acting in an official capacity and instead engaged in a \"private criminal effort\" to overturn the 2020 results. The document is an effort by prosecutors to advance the criminal case against Trump following the Supreme Court ruling in July. It prompted prosecutors to narrow the scope of their indictment. That is because the ruling did not apply immunity to unofficial acts, leading prosecutors to argue that while Trump may still have been in office some of his alleged efforts to overturn the election were related to his campaign and his life as a private citizen. The court should \"determine that the defendant must stand trial for his private crimes as he would any other citizen,\" Mr Smith wrote in the new filing. The case has been frequently delayed since charges were filed by the Department of Justice more than a year ago accusing Trump, who denies wrongdoing, of seeking to illegally block the certification of President Joe Biden's victory. The filing lays out several instances in which Trump's Vice-President, Mike Pence, expressed doubt about his boss's voter fraud claims and tried to persuade him to accept he lost the election. In the court document, prosecutors say Trump was not upset when he learned his vice-president had been rushed to a secure location as rioters stormed the Capitol on 6 January 2021. \"So what?\" he allegedly said, when informed of the scenes. Pence would later go public about his falling out with Trump in the wake of the storming of Congress, when some rioters shouted \"Hang Mike Pence\" because the vice-president refused to obstruct the certification of election results.\n",

      "Amanda Abbington has told the BBC she has \"no regrets\" about making complaints against her 2023 Strictly dance partner Giovanni Pernice. The Sherlock actress said she had suffered \"one of the worst years of my life\" in an interview with BBC Newsnight, and that she had received \"hundreds\" of rape and death threats in the past eight months, with her teenage daughter also targeted. But she said she felt she had done the right thing by speaking up, saying some women have told her \"you're paving the way for my daughter to work in a safe environment and not feel threatened\". The BBC apologised to Abbington this week, upholding complaints of verbal bullying and harassment against Pernice while clearing him of claims of physical aggression.\n",
      "\n",
      "BBC News has been told the BBC's review looked into 17 complaints and six were upheld but we have been unable to independently verify this. The BBC's official statement did not go into detail about the nature of the complaints but a source told BBC News that those upheld related to verbal bullying and harassment. Professional dancer Pernice said he was relieved that allegations he had been threatening and abusive \"were found not to be true\". Speaking to Newsnight presenter Victoria Derbyshire, Abbington said she had experienced \"one of the worst years\" of her life. \"I've been through a lot, women go through a lot, but it has been a very unpleasant, turbulent, relentless time in my life,\" she said. \"I've had to deal with a myriad of horrible things.\"\n",

I've had death threats sent to me, my family. \"I've had rape threats sent to my 15-year-old daughter, saying 'I'm just laughing at the moment thinking about you having to watch your daughter get raped for what you've done to Giovanni Pernice'. \"They were every day I'd be getting those and I have screenshots that have been handed over to the Met Police.\" When asked about her experiences in the rehearsal room, Abbington said it had been \"an ongoing litany of being verbally abused\". \"There was a 35-minute rant at me with him throwing his hands up in the air and calling me names and telling me all sorts of things that I was and how he couldn't really cope with it anymore,\" she said. \"And this went on for, you know, seven hours a day, for seven weeks.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "A former sub-postmaster serving life in prison for murdering his wife is seeking a fresh appeal of his conviction, arguing the Post Office Inquiry has shed new light on his case. Robin Garbutt was found guilty in 2011 of murdering his wife Diana at their home in North Yorkshire the previous year, but has always maintained his innocence. Evidence from the Horizon IT system and the Post Office helped convict him after prosecutors said he had been stealing money from his branch, faked a robbery and killed Diana to cover it up. Garbutt's lawyers have applied to the Criminal Cases Review Commission to have it sent back to the Court of Appeal. Former Post Office Minister Kevin Hollinrake MP told the BBC he was backing a fresh review.\n",
      "\n",
      "Garbutt's wife Diana was found dead in their flat above the post office they ran together in the village of Melsonby in North Yorkshire in 2010. She’d been attacked over the head with a metal bar in her bed. Garbutt claimed they were the victim of an armed robbery. He told police a man forced him to open his Post Office safe at gunpoint and hand over £16,000 before he was able to run upstairs where he discovered his wife's body. But the jury didn’t believe him. The prosecution said he had staged the robbery and had been stealing money from his branch, and then killed Diana to cover it up, fearing he was about to be discovered. They claimed he was in financial difficulty and their relationship also had problems. There was no physical evidence linking him to the murder. A key plank of the case against him was based on data from the Horizon system and how it was interpreted by the Post Office.\n",
      "\n",
      "Family handout\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike the familiar tales from hundreds of other sub-postmasters, this one isn’t about shortfalls in branch accounts. The prosecution claimed Garbutt was concealing his theft by making false declarations on the amount of cash he was holding in his Post Office safe. The suggestion being that he was requesting more than was needed and that that there was never £16,000 in the safe on the morning of the murder because he’d stolen it. Two Post Office witnesses testified against him, relying on data from the Horizon computer system. One investigator said the amount of cash he’d been requesting for his branch account was suspicious and indicative of fraud. Garbutt’s lawyers now argue, in essence, that key parts of the Horizon-related evidence cannot be trusted given what’s emerged from the public inquiry into the scandal and fresh evidence from other sources. Diana’s mother made clear in an interview earlier this year she believes her son-in-law is guilty saying he was \"jumping on the Horizon bandwagon\". But Garbutt’s supporters say, given all the evidence and discrepancies that have been uncovered over the years, he never got a fair trial and it’s time for a wider look at his case. “We believe that fresh evidence and other important developments that have come to light since the original trial, now mean that Mr Garbutt’s conviction is not safe,” says his solicitor Martin Rackstraw from Russell-Cooke, who along with James Sturman KC have been representing Garbutt for some years.\n",

Currently, transfers must be processed or declined by the end of the next business day, but the new law will allow an extension of three more days. For years, banks have needed to have reasonable grounds to suspect fraud before being able to investigate – but have also faced pressure from customers who want payments to be made instantly.

Banks have lobbied for permission to take longer to agree to payments, to allow them to investigate suspicious transfers. The new law will give them time to look at unusual spending patterns, contact a customer, and investigate further before the money is transferred. The previous government's draft legislation had proposed giving banks the new powers by 7 October, but now they will take effect from the end of the month.\n",

At present, newborns are given a heelprick blood test that checks for nine serious conditions, including cystic fibrosis. As part of this new study, led by Genomics England, blood samples will be taken from babies' umbilical cords to help diagnose many more gene disorders, such as haemophilia and spinal muscular atrophy. Hundreds of blood samples have already been collected from babies born at 13 hospitals in England; around 40 hospitals will eventually offer the test.\n",

      "There are approximately 7,000 single gene disorders, but the programme will look only for those disorders that develop in early childhood for which there are effective treatments. In some cases the diseases are curable, if caught early. Screening newborn babies for these rare diseases involves sequencing their complete DNA - or genome - using blood samples from their umbilical cord. At Birmingham Women’s Hospital, which is already offering the screening test, Dominika Nanus, 38, told me it was a “no-brainer” to take part in the study, having seen it advertised on a poster during an antenatal appointment. She said her daughter Emilia, born the previous day, would “benefit directly but also contribute to wider research”. Before she had even named her two-day-old son - now called Hugo - Jemma Jordan, 40, told me she had no hesitation in having him screened, because she would rather know if there were any health issues “from the offset”, and because it would help children in the future. Dr Ellen Thomas, chief medical officer at NHS England, said the 200 conditions the study looks for cause \"substantial health problems early in childhood\". \"The treatments and interventions which are available for all of them can have a dramatic impact on that child,\" she added.\n",

Joshua was apparently healthy at birth, but his mobility began deteriorating at about the age of four, and in the past two years he has lost the ability to walk or talk. Lucy, from Surrey, says it took more than two years of hospital appointments, specialist visits, scans and other procedures before they were given a diagnosis. Had Joshua’s condition been identified at birth he might have been eligible for a clinical trial of a treatment now available on the NHS that can halt the damage done by MLD. Lucy has given up work as Joshua needs round-the-clock care and is tube-fed. She says he may have only another 10 years to live as the genetic condition is progressive. She urged parents to sign up for the screening test. “Do not hesitate. If you can save your child's life, that is more important than anything in this world,\" she said.\n",

      "\n",
      "The BBC has confronted a neo-Nazi in Finland who shared online instructions on how to commit arson with UK rioters during the summer. The 20-year-old was an administrator in the Southport Wake Up group on the Telegram messaging app, where he was known as “Mr AG”. He posted the arson manual, which was pinned to the top of the group chat. In late July and early August, the group was key in helping to organise and provoke protests that turned to violence in England and Northern Ireland. We tracked Mr AG - whose real name is Charles-Emmanuel Mikko Rasanen - to an apartment on the outskirts of the Finnish capital, Helsinki.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was from here, more than 1,000 miles away from Southport, that the neo-Nazi took a prominent online role during the UK riots. On 29 July, within hours of the killings of three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport, the Southport Wake Up group was created. Within days it had grown to more than 14,000 members. Mr Rasanen - or Mr AG as he was known online - helped to run the group chat. The group organised the very first protest in the UK, on St Luke's Road in Southport, the day after the killings. That protest later turned into a riot. Before the group was taken down by Telegram, a series of other protest locations were advertised, as well as a list of dozens of refugee centres, suggested as potential targets. Alongside that list, Mr AG posted the arson manual, writing: “Something fun for you to read.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A link to the arson manual was posted on the Southport Wake Up Telegram group\n",
      "\n",
      "The manual is believed to have been written by a Russian fascist group proscribed as terrorists in their own country. It includes details on how to avoid the police and it encourages the targeting of Muslims and Jews. Underneath the post, other members wrote aggressive and offensive comments, including: “I’m ready for these migrant boys,” while another describes “invaders” as “a stupid bunch underestimating whites”. Mr AG pinned the post to the top of the group, which meant it was in full view of all 14,000 members when they logged in. At the time, several riots had broken out across the UK. The BBC travelled to Finland to confront Mr Rasanen - we had previously emailed him. He refused to answer any of our questions, but did not deny sending the posts or being an administrator of the Southport Wake Up group. Before we left him, he also accused the BBC of harassment and rang the police.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Rasanen accused the BBC of harassment\n",
      "\n",
      "On his Telegram accounts, Mr Rasanen celebrates Hitler and promotes a neo-Nazi group called the Nordic Resistance Movement, which is banned as a terrorist organisation in the US. He also posts voice notes - in one he describes himself as a “national socialist”, and in another he appears to call for the genocide of Jewish people. Veli-Pekka Hämäläinen, an investigative journalist at Yle, Finland’s national broadcaster, says Mr Rasanen has been active online “for many years”. Mr Hämäläinen’s team has also spoken to him about his role in the UK riots. He believes Mr Rasanen's involvement in the Southport Wake Up group transformed him from a solitary extremist into someone with an audience of thousands. “This is an example of how lone internet keyboard warriors can turn dangerous,” says Mr Hämäläinen. He says he has seen Finnish police records, which show Mr Rasanen was investigated when he was a teenager for making an illegal threat, but that he has never been charged with a crime. The BBC has also been told of Mr Rasanen’s previous online links to a far-right white nationalist group in the UK, Patriotic Alternative (PA). He was an active member of a private gaming group chat, and his posts were shared by key figures in PA, according to the British anti-fascist research group, Red Flare. These included the group’s Yorkshire regional organiser, Sam Melia, who was jailed earlier this year for inciting racial hatred. During the time of the UK riots, a post by Mr AG read: “When is the same violence coming to Northern Europe?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr AG contributed to a far-right group chat run by Patriotic Alternative\n",
      "\n",
      "A spokesperson for Red Flare - which first identified Mr AG’s real identity and his links to Southport Wake Up - says Mr Rasanen should be held accountable for what he has done. “What we have here is a case of a young man sitting behind his keyboard in a different country starting racist violence in Britain,” they say. “It exposes the transnational nature of the far-right in the world today.” The BBC contacted Patriotic Alternative, and although the group refused to answer specific questions, it did say what Mr AG posted on PA’s public channel was “fine” and that PA was not involved in what Mr AG posted in other Telegram groups. Speaking to the BBC, the government’s independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, Jonathan Hall KC, says “if [Mr Rasanen] was in the UK he would be arrested and prosecuted under the 2006 Terrorism Act”. Mr Hall estimates at least half of terrorism propaganda prosecutions last year involved the Telegram app. It’s unclear if Finland would extradite one of its own nationals to the UK, and the Home Office has declined to comment on whether any extradition request or other action is being taken in respect of the matter. The BBC is not aware of any arrest warrant being issued. The National Police Board of Finland says it is “aware of the matter”, but it is not possible to comment in more detail. A spokesperson for Telegram has told the BBC its moderators removed UK channels calling for violence when they were discovered in August, including Southport Wake Up. Its statement adds: “Of course, we are ready to co-operate with both the UK and Finnish governments on this matter through the appropriate channels.” A spokesperson for the UK government says it is working at pace to implement the Online Safety Act, which requires social media platforms to remove illegal content and prevent the spread of misinformation. “We will not let the internet serve as a haven for those seeking to sow division in our communities,” says the spokesperson.\n",

The prime minister is covering the cost of six Taylor Swift tickets, four tickets to the races and a clothing rental agreement with a high-end designer favoured by his wife, Lady Victoria Starmer. It comes after Sir Keir and other cabinet ministers have faced weeks of criticism for accepting freebies from wealthy donors. Sir Keir has committed to tightening the rules around ministerial hospitality to improve transparency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking in Brussels on Wednesday, the prime minister said his government would bring forward new principles for donations \"as until now politicians have used their best individual judgement to decide\". \"I took the decision that until those principles were in place it was right to repay these particular payments,” he said. Earlier, a Downing Street spokesperson confirmed that the ministerial code will be updated and will include “a new set of principles on gifts and hospitality” commissioned by Sir Keir. \"Ahead of the publication of the new code, the prime minister has paid for several entries on his own register. \"This will appear in the next register of members' interests.\" A Conservative Party spokesperson said Sir Keir \"will only be transparent when his back's against the wall\". The party said Wednesday's announcement did not explain why the prime minister accepted the donations in the first place and questioned why other senior party members had not paid back their gifts and hospitality. The gifts Starmer has paid for include four Taylor Swift tickets from Universal Music Group worth £2,800, two from the Football Association at a cost of £598, and four to Doncaster Races from Arena Racing Corporation at £1,939. An £839 clothing rental agreement with Edeline Lee, the designer recently worn by his wife to London Fashion Week, along with one hour of hair care and makeup, was also covered by the prime minister. Sir Keir has also accepted a further £6,134 in \"clothing and personal support\" for Lady Starmer in June, from Labour donor Lord Alli. The details of the donations have been published in the latest register of interests for MPs on Wednesday.\n",

      "Warning: This story contains details which some people may find upsetting An Israeli air strike that killed multiple children at a former school twelve days ago had been targeting one local Hamas figure, the BBC has been told. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said a Hamas \"command and control centre\" had been embedded inside the compound in Gaza City, which it targeted in a \"precise strike\" on 21 September. It killed 22 people, including 13 children and six women, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The school, closed during the war, had been housing displaced people, the health ministry said. One young girl, Amal, told the BBC she had been inside the school building when it was hit and saw bodies “torn apart”. “What have we done as children? We wake up and go to sleep terrified,\" she said. “At least protect the schools; we don’t have schools or homes - where do we go?” Sources have told the BBC that one of those killed was a local Hamas figure, meaning many civilians died due to a single main target.\n",

      "Huda Alhadad lost two children – son Muhammad, 13, and daughter Hanan, 12. “I was coming from the hallway when the missile fell. I came and found my husband screaming, saying, 'My children, my children, my children,'\" she told the BBC. “I asked him, 'Where are they?' I searched for them and found them under the rubble.” In the twelve days after the air strike, at least eight more fatal strikes took place in Gaza on school buildings housing displaced families – the latest in a series of attacks on such buildings, which provide little safety. Unicef has said more than 50% of schools used as shelters in Gaza had been directly hit during the current war, with “devastating consequences for children and families”. In each of the latest strikes, the IDF released public statements saying the former schools had contained Hamas terrorists or “command and control” centres.\n",
      "\n",
      "In their public statement about the 21 September strike, the IDF incorrectly named the former school they hit – Al-Zeitoun C – instead identifying another one nearby, Al-Falah. We confirmed that Al-Zeitoun C was the one that had been hit by speaking to local people, as well as comparing videos of the attack aftermath with satellite imagery. The Hamas-run Gazan authorities also named it as Al-Zeitoun C. The relevant area is in the Al-Zeitoun neighbourhood and includes four distinct schools: Al-Falah, and Al-Zeitoun A, B, and C. When asked about incorrectly naming the school, the IDF refused to comment. It would also not comment on who was targeted.\n",

It said that, in addition to those killed, the attack also caused severe injuries, including nine children who needed limbs amputating. Dr Amjad Eliwa, an emergency physician who treated those injured in the strike, described over 30 injuries reaching his hospital, saying they were “mostly among children and women, with cases of amputations and very severe injuries”. He described one of those who died as a woman who was six months pregnant. This was corroborated by images of a foetus at the site of the strike, and residents said the dead woman was Barah Deraawi, who died along with two young daughters, Israa and Iman.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Middle East is once again on the brink of a deep and damaging war between two protagonists that have been facing off against each other for much of the past 45 years. This is now one of the most dangerous moments for the entire region. Iran, which became an Islamic Republic after the overthrow of the Shah in 1979, has long vowed to destroy the state of Israel, which it calls the \"Zionist regime\". Israel accuses Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) of spreading violence across the Middle East through its allies and proxies, a view shared by several Arab governments. Israel is poised to retaliate against Iran for Tuesday’s volley of ballistic missiles, some of which penetrated Israel’s air defences. Iran says that was in response to two assassinations by Israel - of the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut and of the Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. So what happens next? Both Israel and its closest ally, the US, have vowed to punish Iran for launching 180 missiles at Israel. \"Iran,\" says Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, \"will pay a heavy price.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The restraint that Israel’s allies urged on it the last time there was a standoff like this in April is more muted this time. And given Israel’s determination to take on all its enemies at once - in Lebanon, Gaza, Yemen and Syria - the Netanyahu government seems to be in no mood to hold back. Israeli planners will likely now be debating not if and when to hit Iran, but how hard.\n",

      "\n",
      "Aided by US satellite intelligence and by Mossad (Israel’s overseas spy agency) human agents on the ground in Iran, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has a wide range of targets to choose from. These can broadly be divided into three categories: Conventional military - An early and obvious target will be the bases from which Iran launched those ballistic missiles. So that means launch pads, command-and-control centres, refuelling tanks and storage bunkers. It could go further and hit bases belonging to the IRGC as well as air defences and other missile batteries. It could even try to assassinate key individuals involved in Iran’s ballistic missile programme.\n",

This, however, would be a deeply unpopular move in Iran as it would end up hurting ordinary people’s lives far more than any attack on the military. Nuclear - This is the big one for Israel. It is a known fact, established by the UN nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, that Iran is enriching uranium well beyond the 20% needed for civil nuclear power. Israel, and others, suspect Iran of trying to reach \"breakout point\" where it is within a very short timescale of being able to build a nuclear bomb. Sites on Israel’s possible target list include Parchin, the epicentre of Iran’s military nuclear programme, research reactors at Tehran, Bonab and Ramsar, as well as major facilities at Bushehr, Natanz, Isfahan and Ferdow. A large part of their calculations will involve trying to second guess Iran’s response in turn and how to mitigate it. The Iranian position is that after launching those missiles at what it says were Israeli military targets on Tuesday the score is now settled. But it is warning that if Israel retaliates it will hit back in turn. \"This is only a glimpse of our capabilities,\" said Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian. The IRGC reinforced this message, stating: \"If the Zionist regime responds to Iran’s operations, it will face crushing attacks.\"\n",

      "Israel has invaded southern Lebanon in a dramatic escalation of its conflict with Hezbollah. The Israeli ground operation began on Monday night, days after an air strike killed the leader of the Iran-backed armed group, Hassan Nasrallah. Hezbollah has fired hundreds of rockets into northern Israel as Lebanon has endured two weeks of aerial bombardment that Lebanese authorities say has killed more than 1,000 people and forced up to a million to flee their homes. Israel has a decades-long history of conflict with Hezbollah but the war in Gaza has sparked almost a year of deadly cross-border fighting between them. We will be continually updating maps in this page to help explain the conflict. What is Hezbollah and why is Israel attacking Lebanon?\n",
      "\n",
      "Where is Lebanon?\n",
      "\n",
      "Lebanon is a small country with a population of about 5.5 million people, which borders Syria to the north and east, Israel to the south, and the Mediterranean Sea to the west. It is about 170km (105 miles) away from Cyprus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where is the Israeli advance?\n",
      "\n",
      "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says it is carrying out \"limited, localised, and targeted ground raids\" in southern Lebanon to dismantle what it calls Hezbollah's “terrorist infrastructure”. On Wednesday, the second full day of their invasion into Lebanon, Israeli troops encountered Hezbollah fighters for the first time, says the BBC's Nick Beake who is in northern Israel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reuters Israeli tanks at an undisclosed location in northern Israel last week\n",
      "\n",
      "The IDF said soldiers had “eliminated terrorists and dismantled terrorist infrastructure through precision-guided munitions and close-range engagements” in several southern Lebanese areas. Later, the IDF announced that eight troops had been killed in action. Six were reportedly ambushed by Hezbollah fighters and another two were killed by mortar fire. Hezbollah said its fighters had fired anti-tank missiles at Israeli commandos during clashes in one border village. It also claimed that other troops were targeted with explosives and gunfire on the outskirts of Kafr Kila, that three Israeli Merkava tanks were destroyed by missiles near Maroun al-Ras, and that there were also clashes in Adaisseh and Yaroun. A ground operation in southern Lebanon comes with many risks for Israeli forces. Unlike the flat coastal plains of Gaza, southern Lebanon has rolling hills and some mountainous terrain that makes it difficult for tanks to move easily without fear of being ambushed. Hezbollah is also thought to have a network of tunnels in the region, with the group having been preparing for another full-scale conflict with Israel since the 34-day war in 2006.\n",
      "\n",
      "The IDF has ordered people living in some villages in southern Lebanon to evacuate, telling those remaining to leave their homes and \"immediately head to the north of the Awali River\" – which meets the coast about 50km (30 miles) from the border with Israel. Lebanese civilians have also been warned by the IDF not to use vehicles to travel south across the Litani River, located about 30km (20 miles) north of the border. About a million people lived in southern Lebanon before the conflict escalated almost a year ago. Tens of thousands have been fleeing north since Israeli air strikes in the region intensified in late September. Israeli air defences were also in action again on Wednesday, a day after they repelled the vast majority of the more than 180 ballistic missiles launched by Iran towards Israel on Tuesday night in retaliation for the strike that killed Hassan Nasrallah as well as a top Iranian commander. More than 240 rockets were fired from southern Lebanon towards northern Israel throughout the day, according to the IDF. How Israel-Hezbollah conflict escalated to a ground invasion\n",

      "Israel’s invasion of southern Lebanon came after nearly two weeks of intense air strikes targeting Hezbollah’s strongholds across the country. Southern Lebanon has been most affected, with strikes also targeting the eastern Bekaa Valley and in the southern suburbs of Beirut.\n",
      "\n",
      "Israel says it is hitting Hezbollah sites, including weapons stores and ammunition dumps, but Lebanese officials say more than 100 women and children have been killed. For Lebanese civilians trying to flee from southern Lebanon, the main route north is the coastal road that runs the length of the country - but areas along that route have been targeted by air strikes in recent days. The majority of the rockets recently fired by Hezbollah have targeted northern areas of Israel. But some rockets have reached further south and damaged homes near the coastal city of Haifa. The Israeli strikes on Beirut have focused on Dahieh, a southern suburb which is a densely populated area that is home to thousands of civilians and has a strong Hezbollah presence.\n",

Amal Zahereddine, 18, and her sisters Yasmine, 17, and Layla, 22, were among British nationals preparing to leave on a UK government charter flight from Beirut to Birmingham. \"Right now there is no way we can stay. The noises, the situation, is just getting very traumatising so we have no choice,\" Amal said. Israel has stepped up its aerial assault of Beirut in the past week, targeting densely populated areas in the city's south that it said was home to Hezbollah leaders and military equipment. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has told British nationals in Lebanon they \"must leave now\" as fighting continues.\n",

      "Speaking to the BBC from the airport in Beirut, university student Amal said she loved Lebanon and was \"very upset\" at having to leave. \"We're just going to stay hopeful that it's not going to be for long and we're going to come back to our precious country.\" Amal, who was born in Surrey and has lived in Lebanon for five years, said she and her sisters planned to reunite with family in West Sussex. Her sister Yasmine, who is still in school, said she would have never imagined leaving, but the situation required it. Another British citizen, Libby, 25, boarded a commercial flight from Beirut to Cairo on Wednesday morning, and described the situation in the Lebanese capital as \"terrifying\". \"You can't sleep because you can hear the Israeli drones over your head, you wake up in the night because you hear strikes,\" she told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme. As of last week, there were thought to be between 4,000 and 6,000 UK nationals, including dependants, in Lebanon. The chartered flight leaving Beirut on Wednesday will only be able to take a fraction of them, raising questions about whether additional flights will be needed.\n",

      "Colombian government A section of Spanish galleon San José, which sunk off the Caribbean coast of Colombia in 1708\n",
      "\n",
      "It has been hailed as the most valuable shipwreck in the world. A Spanish galleon, the San José, was sunk by the British off the coast of Colombia more than 300 years ago. It had a cargo of gold, silver and emeralds worth billions of dollars. But years after it was discovered, a debate still rages over who owns that treasure and what should be done with the wreck. The Colombian and Spanish states have staked a claim to it, as have a US salvage company and indigenous groups in South America. There have been court battles in Colombia and the US, and the case is now before the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague. The Colombian government says it wants to raise the remains of the vessel and put it in a museum. Treasure hunters point to the commercial value of the cargo, which could be as much as $18bn (£13.bn).\n",
      "\n",
      "But archaeologists say the wreck – and thousands like it scattered across the world – should be left where it is. Maritime historians remind us that the San José is a graveyard and should be respected as such: around 600 people drowned when the ship went down. “It’s a great mess and I see no easy way out of this,” says Carla Rahn Phillips, a historian who has written a book about the San José. “The Spanish state, the Colombian government, the various indigenous groups, the treasure hunters. I don’t think there’s any way that everyone can be satisfied.” BBC Business Daily - Who owns the $18bn shipwreck? Colombia begins exploring ‘holy grail of shipwrecks’ New artefacts found on San José shipwreck The San José sank in 1708 as it sailed from what is now Panama towards the port city of Cartagena in Colombia. From there it was due to cross the Atlantic to Spain, but the Spanish were at war with the British at the time, and a British warship intercepted it. The British wanted to seize the ship and its treasure, but fired a cannonball into the San José’s powder magazines by mistake. The ship blew up and sank within minutes. The wreck lay on the seabed until the 1980s, when a US salvage company, Glocca Mora, said it had found it. It tried to persuade the Colombians to go into partnership to raise the treasure and split the proceeds, but the two sides could not agree on who should get what share, and plunged into a legal battle. In 2015, the Colombians said they had found the ship, independently of the information provided by the Americans, on a different part of the sea bed. Since then they have argued that Glocca Mora, now known as Sea Search Armada, has no right to the ship or its treasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "National Maritime Museum The San José was attacked and sunk by the British, as depicted in this 18th-Century painting\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spanish state has staked its claim, arguing that the San José and its cargo remains state property, and indigenous groups from Bolivia and Peru say they are entitled to at least a part of the booty. They argue that it is not Spanish treasure because it was plundered by the Spanish from mines in the Andes during the colonial period. “That wealth came from the mines of Potosí in the Bolivian highlands,” says Samuel Flores, a representative of the Qhara Qhara people, one of the indigenous groups. “This cargo belongs to our people – the silver, the gold – and we think it should be raised from the sea bed to stop treasure hunters looting it. How many years have gone by? Three hundred years? They owe us that debt.” The Colombians have released tantalising videos of the San José, taken with submersible cameras. They show the prow of a wooden ship, encrusted with marine life, a few bronze cannons scattered across the sand, and blue-and-white porcelain and gold coins shining on the ocean floor. As part of its court case at the Hague, Sea Search Armada commissioned a study of the cargo. It estimates its value at $7-18bn. “This treasure that sank with the ship included seven million pesos, 116 steel chests full of emeralds, 30 million gold coins,” says Rahim Moloo, the lawyer representing Sea Search Armada. He described it as “the biggest treasure in the history of humanity”. Others are less convinced.\n",

      "Reuters The Colombian government sent a team to explore the wreck earlier this year\n",

      "“I try to resist giving present-day estimates of anything,” says Ms Rahn Phillips. \"If you’re talking about gold and silver coins, do we make an estimate based on the weight of the gold now? Or do we look at what collectors might pay of these gold coins? \"To me it’s almost meaningless to try to come up with a number now. The estimates of the treasure hunters, to me, they’re laughable.” While the San José is often described as the holy grail of shipwrecks, it is – according to the United Nations - just one of around three million sunken vessels on our ocean floors. There is often very little clarity over who owns them, who has the right to explore them, and – if there is treasure on board – who has the right to keep it. In 1982, the United Nations adopted the Convention on the Law of the Sea – often described as “the constitution of the oceans”, but it says very little about shipwrecks. Because of that, the UN adopted a second set of rules in 2001 – the Unesco Underwater Cultural Heritage 2001 Convention. That says far more about wrecks, but many countries have refused to ratify it, fearing it will weaken their claim to riches in their waters. Colombia and the US, for example, have not signed it. “The legal framework right now is neither clear nor comprehensive,” says Michail Risvas, a lawyer at Southampton University in the UK. A specialist in international arbitration and maritime disputes, he adds: “I’m afraid international law does not have clear-cut answers.”\n",

      "BBC Nancy Berry tried to rescue her family mementos from the floods - but much of it was lost\n",
      "\n",
      "For over 40 years, Nancy Berry’s trailer in the town of Boone was her mountain oasis and her family’s homestead. It was where she created memories with family and friends, and where she preserved the memories of those lost. Her mother died in the same trailer. But it took just a matter of hours for Hurricane Helene to wash it all away. Now, the 77-year-old is trying to salvage what remains. On her bed, still soaked from the floods, she’s placed mementos of who she was, and where she came from. On top of the pile, her son’s death certificate from when he died of Covid three years ago. “I grabbed it and laid it out,” she told the BBC. “I’ve got to protect my family’s history. A lot of it is lost though.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was Ms Berry’s great-niece who saved her, helping her wade through three to four feet of water. “They kept calling me – thank God for the cell phones. You never know, a long time ago, what would have happened,” Ms Berry recalled. When her great-niece arrived, she found Ms Berry trying to save some of her belongings by putting them up high. “Aunt Nanny. Come on. Get out. Get out,” she called out. “I’m coming, I’m coming!” Ms Berry replied. She grabbed her purse, handing it to her great-niece, who carried it over her head while helping Ms Berry to safety. “She's strong and she was just pushing me, pulling and that water was – ,” Ms Berry, said, shuddering. “It was not a nice moment.”\n",

      "Western North Carolina, located more than 300 miles (482km) from the ocean, is no stranger to storms, said Kathie Dello, a climate expert at North Carolina State University. Six people died when a tropical storm caused “catastrophic” flooding in nearby Carusoe – but nothing like this, she said. At least 180 people are now known to have died. More than 600 are still unaccounted for. Thousands are without power, and fresh water supplies are dwindling. The government has deployed 6,000 National Guard members and 4,800 federal aid workers to the region, but many have criticised the response, saying that the bulk of rescue efforts have been left up to volunteers. \"We were cut off from [the outside world] for about three days,\" said Kennie McFee, the fire chief for Green Valley. \"Here, it was mainly neighbours helping neighbours.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms Berry's trailer park in Boone was almost entirely destroyed\n",
      "\n",
      "The cities of Boone and Asheville were hard hit, but remote communities located deep within the Appalachian Mountains are also seriously struggling, Diello told the BBC. Even before the storm, mobile reception and Wi-Fi was patchy. Poverty and rough, rural roads have added to the difficulties people have faced getting out. “A lot of times people say ‘well, why didn’t they leave?’,” Diello said. “Well maybe you can't afford a tank of gas, and how many nights in a hotel in a safer place? Maybe you know you can't leave your family, maybe you can't leave your job.” In Green Valley, a woman, who did not want the BBC to use her name, said that five days after the storm she still had no power and no communication with the outside world. Her only functioning device was a battery powered antenna radio that she said was decades-old. \"If you're raised in the mountains, you'll cope,\" she said. While talking with the BBC, a car pulled up to bring her news of her family, who she hadn't seen or heard from since the storm hit. \"They were all okay, another thank you, Lord,\" she said. Although she recalled bad storms, she said she's never seen anything like Helene. \"God is getting people's attention. He really is getting people's attention, not just here, but it's everywhere,\" she said. \"But I really think it's just, it's to let us know who's in control.\"\n",

      "Content: The chancellor says she needs to raise £20bn. How might she do it?\n",
      "\n",
      "BBC\n",
      "\n",
      "You’re the chancellor. You want around £20bn of extra tax revenue each year. So how should you go about finding it? We’re just a few weeks from the government’s crucial first Budget on 30 October and it’s clear Chancellor Rachel Reeves intends to raise money. There is a black hole in public finances, she says - based on her apparent discovery since arriving at No 11 Downing Street in July of an unbudgeted £22bn overspend in the current tax year. Now, whether that really is a newly discovered black hole is a matter of dispute. Either way, given Ms Reeves has ruled out borrowing to fund day-to-day spending, she is still likely to need to raise taxes to pay for that spending. So if you were in her position, how might you go about raising it? Let’s not pretend this is too precise a game - we’ll call the figure £20bn for simplicity’s sake. This figure is somewhat arbitrary. In truth, the overspend this year is of little relevance when it comes to how much extra tax you need next year or in five years' time. And one imagines the Budget will mostly find tax rises that bite in 2025-26 and beyond. In any event, when the Budget comes, we will have an updated economics forecast, new projections for how government revenues and spending are looking, possibly a new fiscal target as well. So a lot will change by 30 October.\n",
      "\n",
      "How to raise £20bn: The full series BBC Radio 4’s PM has set itself the task of answering this taxing question in a series of five interviews, each exploring a different solution, before turning to our listeners to hear their ideas. Listen on BBC Sounds\n",
      "\n",
      "Nonetheless, if you were a chancellor with the task of finding £20bn in front of you, then you would probably like the option of being able to increase the rates of one of the big four taxes: income tax, VAT, National Insurance and corporation tax. Together, they represent two-thirds of the total cash that the government receives. However, for better or worse, the chancellor ruled out such tax rises in the election campaign, and she has made it quite clear that she is not going to abandon her pledges. So for our purposes, such tax rises are clearly verboten. That is a significant constraint. Remember that in its last year, the Conservative government cut taxes by £20bn by slashing the rate of National Insurance. One way of raising money would simply be to reverse that cut and take us back to where we were before last November. So by ruling out a Tory National Insurance cut reversal, the chancellor has made our game of finding £20bn far more… taxing. But once you’ve put all those tax rises to one side, there are still more potential routes to raising extra revenue that we can look at. One is through capital gains tax, charged on profits made from the sale of an asset that has increased in value, such as second homes or shares not held in individual savings accounts (ISAs). But when it comes to capital gains tax “I don’t think immediately it will raise a vast amount of money”, says Judith Freedman, emeritus professor of tax law and policy at the University of Oxford. “It might bring in a few billion, it’s not going to give you £20bn.” Another route is through inheritance tax. But this “only kicks in when you are quite wealthy”, says Dan Neidle, founder of the think tank Tax Policy Associates. Between them, capital gains tax and inheritance tax raise less than £25bn a year at the moment, so to get an extra £5bn would still require a sizable jump in those taxes. However, there are also ways you could raise cash through higher National Insurance or income tax, without actually changing their headline rates. When it comes to National Insurance and income tax, far bigger amounts are at stake if the chancellor is minded to look at the rules governing the tax treatment of pension contributions. At the moment, for most people, if you put any earnings into a pension, you don’t pay income tax on those earnings. And if employers contribute to a pension on your behalf, they don’t pay employers’ National Insurance on that, as they would if they gave it to you as salary. Between them, these perks cost the exchequer about £50bn a year. Most of that benefit goes to higher earners, who not only put more into their pension pots, but who often deduct income tax at a higher rate than the average worker. It is an area ripe for reform. Indeed, the right-of-centre think tank, the Centre for Policy Studies, proposed a radical reform of the system 12 years ago. A left-of-centre chancellor will be keen on the potential revenue to be found here.\n",

      "Getty Images Chancellor Rachel Reeves will announce her Budget on 30 October\n",
      "\n",
      "Now it has to be said, when it comes to squeezing more tax out of a population, there are two broad approaches a chancellor can take. We might call them the expedient and the economic. The expedient is to search for places where you can raise money with a minimum of squealing. On this approach, there doesn’t have to be much logic to any tax rise - it’s just about finding the money in hidden corners. The economic approach is slightly different. It starts with the idea that there are more and less logical ways to tax people, and that the tax system should avoid picking on certain types of activity in arbitrary ways. In this world, you usually want to avoid taxing some income or savings more than other income or savings, because that would likely be unfair and it would distort people’s decisions. On this account, you need to have a vision for how all the pieces of the tax system interact. “Fiscal neutrality” is a phrase that has sometimes been used to describe a system that is designed to tax in as level a way as possible. And although our tax system is manifestly full of anomalies and illogicalities, when it comes to pensions specifically, economists often share a broad vision of what a fiscally neutral tax system should try to do. The basic principle is that people should pay tax once - not twice - on pensions. So you either give tax relief upfront, on the money people put into their pension savings, then you tax the pension income people enjoy when they get old. Or you give no upfront relief at all and tax the income going into a pension fund, but you charge no tax on the pension when it comes out. Judged against these principles of neutrality, our current system is a bit of a mess. Many people get 40% income tax relief on what goes into a pension and pay 20% on what comes out. That’s not logical. Also, employers’ National Insurance isn’t charged at either end; and you can get a tax-free lump sum when you take a pension, even though you had tax relief on the money you contributed to that. You don’t need to understand all these details to see that a chancellor who wants extra tax revenue can look at pension contributions and will see an orchard full of ripe fruit for picking. And what makes it very compelling is that the orchard looks bountiful whether you’re gazing at it through the glasses of expediency or through the lens of economic logic. Sir Edward Troup, a tax lawyer who has worked in the Treasury, expects the chancellor to take action in this area in the Budget. “The question is how far, how fast does she go?” he says. “Does she really try and get some money in the next few years – which will be painful – or does she introduce some reforms that have got slow burn and build up tax receipts from people who are retiring over the next five, 10, 20, 30 years?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I also wonder whether the Budget will try to tidy up the illogicalities of the system, or simply be about raising as much as possible? It’s possible, of course, that there could be important tax changes other than those I’ve talked about. More than one of PM’s listeners wrote in to suggest a new tax on land values (an idea popular with the Greens and sometimes the Liberal Democrats). It may be a step too far for this Budget, even if it’s one that many economists find appealing. An important thing to note is that a £20bn tax rise will be significant for the exchequer, but it’s by no means enormous in historic terms. It’s equivalent to about £6 a week, for every man, woman and child in the country or £25 each week for a family of four. Another way of looking at it is that would keep NHS England going for about 40 days a year. Or putting it another way, £20bn is less than 1% of our annual national income. And it’s about 1.7% of total government spending. It’s not revolutionary, but nor is it nothing. And we’ll have to wait until 30 October to see exactly which approach Rachel Reeves takes.\n",

      "Robert Jenrick talked about rising energy prices, which he said had caused factories to close and families to suffer. “This is all because we have become so reliant on expensive forms of energy like offshore wind,” he said. It is not true to say that offshore wind is the driver of high energy prices. In the UK, electricity prices are usually determined by the price of gas. For this reason, when gas prices spiked in 2022 following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, electricity prices rose sharply as well. While offshore wind was relatively expensive in the 2000s and early 2010s, it has generally been getting cheaper since. As a result, the National Infrastructure Commission said last year that the “cost of renewable electricity, through offshore wind, onshore wind and solar, is lower and less volatile than producing electricity with natural gas”. The government’s independent adviser, the Climate Change Committee, has also said that the most effective long-term way to cut energy bills is to move away from fossil fuels. And in a global report earlier this year the International Energy Agency concluded that the “rapid rollout of clean technologies makes energy cheaper, not more costly”.\n",

      "Sir Keir Starmer has made his first visit to Brussels since becoming prime minister. His main message: to rebuild ties and trust with the EU after the bitter bickering of Brexit negotiations. The moment was predictably rain-soaked but not insignificant. Union flags were placed next to EU ones on press podiums. The red carpet at the European Parliament was washed down and hoovered ahead of Sir Keir’s arrival. Ursula von der Leyen, the powerful president of the European Commission, gushed that his welcome was a warm one. And the prime minister did not come empty-handed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wish list he brought here was long. He called for closer co-operation on defence and security, including energy security, as well as on climate change, irregular migration, labelled 'illegal migration' under the previous Conservative government and on delivering economic growth - to help make Brexit work in the UK’s interest, he said. He insisted the British public wanted a return to what he called sensible leadership when it came to the EU. His European interlocutors nodded but without much evident enthusiasm. The bloc still regrets losing the UK as a member. It bemoans the huge amount of time and political capital Brussels spent on Brexit negotiations. It has little appetite for more protracted talks – and that was what was announced today - if the risk is high of going round in circles. Working together better on security and defence is the most straightforward and uncontentious path of rapprochement. Relations have steadily improved since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The two sides worked rapidly and closely to impose sanctions on Moscow and boost Kiev’s defences. The UK leading the way on the latter. One point of division amongst EU member states, though, is whether British businesses could or should be involved in the bloc’s rearmament drive. On migration, there’s clear cross-Channel agreement that people-smuggling gangs must be stopped and irregular migration, tackled. The 'How?' could get thorny though. The French and German interior ministers recently asked the European Commission to reach a formal agreement with the UK, urging it to open more legal avenues to allow asylum seekers and others to enter the country. The ministers said up to a third of irregular migrants coming their way, actually wanted to go to the UK.\n",

      "Content: Fly brain breakthrough 'huge leap' to unlock human mind\n",
      "\n",
      "MRC/Nature As beautiful as it is complex, the fly's brain has more than 130,000 wires with 50 million intricate connections\n",
      "\n",
      "They can walk, hover and the males can even sing love songs to woo mates - all this with a brain that’s tinier than a pinhead. Now for the first time scientists researching the brain of a fly have identified the position, shape and connections of every single one of its 130,000 cells and 50 million connections. It's the most detailed analysis of the brain of an adult animal ever produced. One leading brain specialist independent of the new research described the breakthrough as a \"huge leap\" in our understanding of our own brains. One of the research leaders said it would shed new light into “the mechanism of thought”. Dr Gregory Jefferis, of the Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB) in Cambridge told BBC News that currently we have no idea how the network of brain cells in each of our heads enables us to interact with each other and the world around us. “What are the connections? How do the signals flow through the system that can let us process the information to recognise your face, that lets you hear my voice and turn these words into electrical signals? “The mapping of the fly brain is really remarkable and will help us get a real grasp of how our own brains work.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We have a million times as many brain cells, or neurons, than the fruit fly which was studied. So how can the wiring diagram of an insect brain help scientists learn how we think? The images the scientists have produced, which have been published in the journal Nature, show a tangle of wiring that is as beautiful as it is complex. Its shape and structure holds the key to explaining how such a tiny organ can carry out so many powerful computational tasks. Developing a computer the size of a poppy seed capable of all these tasks is way beyond the ability of modern science. Dr Mala Murthy, another of the project’s co-leaders, from Princeton University, said the new wiring diagram, known scientifically as a connectome, would be “transformative for neuroscientists”. “It will help researchers trying to better understand how a healthy brain works. In the future we hope that it will be possible to compare what happens when things go wrong in our brains.” That is a view backed by Dr Lucia Prieto Godino, a group leader in brain research at the Francis Crick Institute in London, who is independent of the research team. \"Researchers have completed the connectomes of a simple worm which has 300 wires and a maggot which has three thousand, but having a complete connectome of something with 130,000 wires is an amazing technical feat which paves the way for finding the connectomes for larger brains such as the mouse and maybe in several decades our own.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The researchers have been able to identify separate circuits for many individual functions and show how they are connected. The wires involved with movement for example are at the base of the brain, whereas those for processing vision are towards the side. There are many more neurons involved in the latter because seeing requires much more computational power. While scientists already knew about the separate circuits they did not know how they were connected together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why are flies so difficult to swat?\n",
      "\n",
      "Other researchers are already using the circuit diagrams, for example to work out why flies are so difficult to swat. The vision circuits detect which direction your rolled up newspaper is coming from, and they pass on the signal to the fly's legs. But crucially, they send a stronger jumping signal to the legs facing away from the object of their imminent demise. So you could say they jump away without even having to think – literally faster than the speed of thought. This finding may explain why we lumbering humans seldom squash flies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gwyndaf Hughes/BBC News The fly brain slicer: it was cut into 7,000 incredbly thin pieces using this microscopic knife\n",
      "\n",
      "The wiring diagram was made by slicing up a fly brain using what is essentially a microscopic cheese grater, photographing each of the 7,000 slices and digitally putting them altogether. Then the Princeton team applied artificial intelligence to extract the shapes and connections of all the neurons. But the AI wasn’t perfect – the researchers still had to fix over three million mistakes by hand. This in itself was a technical tour de force, but the job was only half done. The map on its own was meaningless unless there was a description of what each wire was supposed to do, according to Dr Philipp Schlegel, who is also from the Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Molecular Biology. “This data is a bit like Google Maps but for brains: the raw wiring diagram between neurons is like knowing which structures correspond to streets and buildings. \"Describing the neurons is like adding the names for streets and towns, business opening times, phone numbers, reviews, etc. to the map. You need both for it to be really useful.”\n",

      "\n",
      "An inquest has found that there were \"significant time lapses\" in mental health treatment for a man who killed his parents during a psychotic episode. James Andrews, known to his family as Duncan, killed Mary, 76, and Bryan Andrews, 79, at their home in Terrey Road, Totley, in Sheffield, in November 2022. Senior coroner Tanyka Rawden was told on Wednesday that he was denied a referral to specialist services after complaining of episodes thought to have been brought on by epileptic seizures. Sheffield Health and Social Care NHS Foundation Trust's interim medical director, Helen Crimlisk, told the hearing that \"a number of changes\" had been made since the tragedy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms Rawden said: “Had there been regular and appropriate interaction between services, and had the early intervention service referral been accepted, it is possible that treatment could have been given.” Andrews was given an indefinite hospital order in July 2023 after he admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Family handout James Duncan Andrews admitting killing his parents at a criminal court hearing\n",
      "\n",
      "The court heard how he had accessed mental health services in November 2011 when he suffered a seizure, leading to him feeling paranoid. Andrews had complained about having psychotic episodes, including suicidal thoughts, and told a helpline “something serious is going to happen”, said Dr Jonathan Mitchell, consultant psychiatrist. Giving evidence, Prof Markus Reuber, honorary consultant at the Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said those who were epileptic were more likely to be depressed and it was “extremely common” for people to have mental health issues such as anxiety after seizures. All anti-seizure medication, such as that which Andrews had been prescribed during treatment, has side effects which could include depression, the court was told. A referral to Sheffield Health and Social Care’s early intervention team was refused in mid-2022. This decision meant an opportunity to identify whether Andrews' psychotic episodes were persistent was missed, the inquest in Sheffield heard. This referral could have helped Andrews be given different treatment, the coroner said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr and Mrs Andrews were killed at the home on Terrey Road, Totley, Sheffield\n",
      "\n",
      "It is believed that two days before Andrews killed his parents he had four seizures, a report from doctors at the secure unit he was staying at stated. At the time of the killings, he was likely to be suffering from postictal psychosis, a mental health condition after a seizure where the person can have aggressive outbursts, Prof Reuber said. There were “clearly structural problems” in the way notes between mental health teams and neurology teams were shared, the consultant added. This meant doctors prescribing medication might not know that some patients have mental health conditions unless they are specifically told, Prof Reuber added. The coroner said there was a concern around communication between services at the trust, especially looking at “the relationship diagnosis of epilepsy and psychotic symptoms” with Andrews. “This led to significant time lapses between treatment, and rejection to services, most notably the early intervention service.” A prevention of future deaths report would be sent to Sheffield Health and Social Care looking at the communication between services, “in particular between psychiatrists and neurology”, Ms Rawden said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sally Andrews (right) gave a statement to the media outside the court alongside her sister Lucie\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr and Mrs Andrews' daughters Sally and Lucie read out a family statement outside the coroner's court. They described their father as a \"true Yorkshireman\" who loved ballroom dancing, while their mother was a \"people person\" who made lunches for elderly neighbours. Together they were called “a team of enviable strength”. The sisters found their parents fatally injured at their home. Sally told the court there was “some comfort that we, including Duncan, were there together for one final time”. “They would have been absolutely devastated that day,” she added. Speaking on a video link from a secure hospital, James Duncan Andrews said: “I loved my parents right to the end. I wish this had never happened.” He thanked his sisters for their support during the inquest. \"We are deeply sorry for the tragic loss of Bryan and Mary Andrews in November 2022, and our heartfelt sympathies remain with their family,\" Ms Crimlisk, from the NHS trust, said. \"All those involved with Duncan’s care have taken immediate steps to learn from this tragedy. We have already made a number of changes and we will continue to make improvements to address the concerns highlighted through the inquest process.\" The coroner recorded a conclusion that Mr and Mrs Andrews were unlawfully killed.

Natasha Murray was 16 when a lorry crashed into her school bus on the A4 road in 2008, before the road was improved. Her sister Nicola lost her life in the collision and soon after the stretch of road between Dungannon and Ballygawley received a new dual carriageway. After that work fatalities on the road dramatically reduced. The A4 leads onto the A5, which links County Tyrone and Londonderry, and that road has seen 57 road deaths recorded on it since 2006.\n",

John O’Dowd said that work on the project would begin in early 2025 and would be completed on a phased basis.

      "Reacting to the news Natasha said it was “bittersweet” and has also called for the full route to be upgraded to a dual carriageway. She said: “My sister lost her life on road that was very similar and just as dangerous as the A5, it was quickly made safer and that’s why I feel so strongly about the A5. “Obviously I think the A5 upgrade going ahead is positive, but it shouldn’t have taken so long. \"People have lost their lives waiting for this road to be upgraded.”\n",
      "\n",
      "'Some days I wake up and don’t believe she died'\n",

      "Natasha has previously described how she held her sister as people tried to save her life. She said: “It’s 16 years on from the accident, so Nicola is now gone as long as she was here and some days I still wake up and actually don’t believe she died. “I was able to walk away from the accident that day, and I never take that for granted, I just try and do her justice by living my life to the full and she is part of my family’s daily conversations, so she is very much alive in that sense. “ The A4 route from Dungannon to Ballygawley where Nicola died was upgraded to a dual carriageway in November 2010.\n",

      "'A4 upgrade brought comfort to my family'\n",
      "\n",
      "Nicola Murray was 16 years old when she died\n",
      "\n",
      "Since then Natasha and her family have supported the campaign to get a similar upgrade to the A5, a road she can see from her living room window. She said: “Getting the upgrade to the A4 did bring comfort to me and my family, knowing that it was safer, and I have always wanted that for the families impacted by deaths on the A5. “The A4 dual carriageway is now a road that is fully equipped to deal with the volume of traffic travelling on it, where as the A5 as it currently is, there is zero margin for error, so an upgrade is long overdue.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Losing land and environmental concerns\n",
      "\n",
      "Approximately 1,200 hectares of land, impacting more than 300 working farms would be required for the construction of the full 85km A5 carriageway. Groups like the Alternative A5 Alliance (AA5A) have repeatedly raised concerns about losing land that has been in their families for generations. They had called for the existing A5 road to be improved and pointed to the environmental impact of constructing such a large-scale project, as well as unresolved issues about building the new road near potential flood plains. Meanwhile, police figures have shed light on the cause of crashes on the A5, putting focus on driver responsibility. Driver error is the most common cause of fatal road traffic accidents on the A5, but it is also the most common cause of fatal accidents on the majority of roads across Northern Ireland.\n",
      "\n",
      "The A5 is a vital artery of the Northern Ireland road network\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile a previous investigation by BBC News NI found that the between 2012 and 2024, the A5 had the highest rate of deaths per kilometre of any road in Northern Ireland. Natasha Murray said she understood the concerns around construction of a new A5, but believes the success of the A4 dual carriageway is evidence of what can be achieved. Figures show that there were 37 fatalities on the A4 road in the 10 years before an upgraded dual carriageway opened in 2010. Following the upgrade and between 2011 and 2018, there were two fatalities on the new A4 dual carriageway\n",

      "Police Scotland Jamie Stevenson had been one of the UK's most wanted men\n",
      "\n",
      "A Scottish gangster who orchestrated a plot to smuggle cocaine worth £100m from South America in boxes of bananas has been jailed for 20 years. Jamie ‘Iceman’ Stevenson admitted directing the importation of the drug, which was seized by Border Force teams at Dover in September 2020. The other members of his gang were jailed for a total of 29 years. The plot was uncovered after an encrypted messaging platform used by criminals was infiltrated by French police.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stevenson had also planned to flood Scotland with millions of Etizolam tablets, also known as street valium, from a factory in Kent. The 59-year-old, from Rutherglen in South Lanarkshire, was a leading figure at the top level of organised crime in Scotland. He was once described as Scotland’s answer to Tony Soprano, the mafia boss portrayed in television series The Sopranos. In 2022, he featured on a list of the UK’s 12 most wanted men.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last month Stevenson admitted his role in producing and supplying Etizolam and smuggling a tonne of cocaine - which police estimated would have been worth £100m on the streets – into the UK. He was jailed for a total of 20 years when he appeared for sentencing at the High Court in Glasgow. Five other men - David Bilsland, 68; Paul Bowes, 53; Gerard Carbin, 45; Ryan McPhee, 34; and Lloyd Cross, 32 - also pled guilty to serious organised crime and drug offences. Carbin was jailed for seven years; Bilsland, Bowes and Cross were each jailed for six years; and McPhee was jailed for four years. Lewis Connor, 27, was jailed for three years in July after the investigation found encrypted phone messages which proved he had set fire to properties and vehicles across Central Scotland.\n",

      "\n",
      "The drugs operation, which spanned the UK, Spain, Ecuador and Abu Dhabi, had been targeted by police in an inquiry which was named Operation Pepperoni. Officers had been investigating reports that Bilsland, a Glasgow fruit merchant, had links with organised crime. He was then seen meeting Stevenson in a hotel in Spain. At about the same time, officers had learned that Stevenson was involved in setting up a factory in Kent which was producing millions of Etizolam tablets. The factory was raided in June 2020 and Stevenson was arrested in Glasgow. He was taken to England by police before being released on bail. He then fled the UK, spending almost two years on the run before being arrested in the Netherlands. The National Crime Agency said Stevenson continued to direct the importation of cocaine into the UK from abroad.\n",

      "Prosecutor Alex Prentice KC earlier told the court that the messages on the encrypted phone network EncroChat showed Stevenson discussing plans to import kilo blocks of cocaine with Cross, as well as the use of Bilsland provide “an appearance of legitimacy”. A tonne of the drug was seized in a raid by Border Force teams at Dover in September 2020. They found 119 packages of cocaine concealed in boxes of bananas from Ecuador, which were destined for Glasgow. It took officers three days to recover the drugs from the shipment. Defence counsel Thomas Ross KC told the court Stevenson had known exactly what he was doing and had made “a series of bad decisions” for which the motivation was obvious. “He takes ownership of all those decisions and doesn’t seek to cast blame in anybody else’s direction,” he said.\n",

      "South Wales Police/PA Media Lynette White was murdered in a flat in Cardiff's docklands in 1988\n",
      "\n",
      "A murderer at the centre of one of Wales' most notorious killings will make his case to be freed from prison later. Lynette White was stabbed more than 50 times and had her throat slit in a Cardiff docklands flat on Valentine's Day 1988, but Jeffrey Gafoor was not jailed until 2003. Instead, in 1990, Stephen Miller, Yusef Abdullahi and Tony Paris were jailed for life for the 20-year-old's murder in what was deemed to be a gross miscarriage of justice. Thursday's parole hearing - which will be held in private - will be Gafoor's sixth, but the decision may not be made for up to 14 days.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three applications for this hearing to be public were refused, with the parole board saying it was \"not appropriate\" as it would be assessing \"current risk\". John Actie, one of five men who wrongly spent time in prison for the killing, said it should \"definitely\" be public.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he was jailed in 2003, Gafoor was ordered to serve a minimum of 13 years after confessing to stabbing Ms White - a sex worker - in a row over £30. He was granted day release in January 2023. After Ms White's murder, detectives investigating the case said they were hunting a white suspect. Instead, five black and mixed-race men were arrested and charged with murder before their convictions were quashed by the Court of Appeal. Gafoor was not caught until there were advances in DNA technology.\n",
